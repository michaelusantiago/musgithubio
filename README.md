# https://michaelusantiago.github.io (Source)

This is the source file that generates the site https://michaelusantiago.github.io

This is written in svelte-ts 3.x.x utilizing `svelte-spa-router`

I build `npm run build` this and this will generate compiled static site output in `michaelusantiago.github.io` which will then become the source of my github website.

The next step then is to push the built version in my github repo.
